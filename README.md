This repository contains the scripts and other information used to process data for the Community Data Health Initiative (CDHI). 

The vehicle emissions data is sourced from "2020 Near-roadway population census, traffic exposure and equity in the United States" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2023.103965) and is tied to the 2018 Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) from the U.S. Department of Transportation. 

There are four pollutant classes in the data - PM2.5, PM10, NOx, and NO2. The emissions estimates for these pollutants are aggregated by vehicle classes as defined by the EPA. These classes are Light Duty Vehicles (LDV), Medium Duty Vehicles (MDV), and Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV).
